# Base Portal For AWS ML Workshops

This project is the framework for an AWS AI/ML Workshop portal. Once clones and populated with content it can be used to create a temporary website for an online workshop with event engine, help etc

We'll remove this section once the Portal is in a clean, stable, ready to be clones state

### TODOs
1. Clear out Security speicific content
